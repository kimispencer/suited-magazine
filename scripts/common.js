Our objective is to showcase independent thinkers ardent about creating work that is at once inspired, influential and timeless. <br /><br /> The individuals featured in this debut issue work with varied media and genres, but all live for the autonomy that results from superseding expectation. <br /><br /> Photographed by Paul Jung, the subjects of our debut issue\'s champion cover story -- South Sudanese models Mari Malek, Mari Agory, Nykhor Paul and Atong Arjok -- are raising their voices to effect change in their home country. Passionately dedicated to the needs of others, these women are opening up a dialogue not only among their fellow citizens but around the world.',

			copy: 'The individuals featured in our second issue cannot be easily categorized. Their work—in fashion, art, design, music, activism and more—is, for each of them, a true expression of the Self.<br><br>Model, artist and writer Myla DalBesio explores this concept of the Self for our cover story, photographed by Paul Jung. Her essay—a memoir of the body, a life\’s history told in the flesh—reveals the essential connection between the inner and outer selves. By cataloging the physical she lays bare the emotional life within us all.'

			copy: 'Beauty may be the ultimate enigma: infinite, immeasurable and timeless. Often found in the darker reaches of pain and suffering, it is in life and death, in struggle and triumph. Beauty\'s one constant is its sphinx-like inscrutability; no two people will see it the same way or find it in the same place. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but it is also something held deep within ourselves. Yet the fact that beauty cannot be defined has not stopped an industry from trying, not only in categorizing our differences but homogenizing them, too. Our cover story, photographed by Nicholas Alan Cope, highlights Patricia Black, a woman who is unapologetically herself in embracing these differences. A curator and “stylist to the stylists,” she is in many ways the consummate insider, yet she remembers the feeling of being on the outside looking in, of wanting, as she puts it, to “belong in the room.” She has encouraged a much-needed realness in the industry, her dynamic energy a testament to a life lived true to herself. With this issue, we join Black in defining beauty on our own terms.'

			copy: 'With social justice at the forefront of our collective minds, rocking the frayed political climate that grapples to understand an ever-evolving cerebral landscape, there’s no better time than now to devote ourselves to the importance of community. Undoubtedly, there is strength in numbers, and in inspiring ideas. <br /><br /> No one knows this better than the guys that make up Ghetto Gastro, a culinary crew from the Bronx that’s shaking things up in the kitchen and, as SUITED writer Matthew Ismael Ruiz says, “bringing the bodega to the bourgeoisie.” Clever wordsmiths with their dishes, Jon Gray, Lester Walker, Pierre Serrao, and Malcolm Livingston II can boil themselves down to one single expression—two syllables that carry the ethos of their efforts—and that’s “sturdy.” You’re only as strong as your foundation, the Ghetto Gastro guys agree. The term might get dropped next year, they concede, but we never expected them to settle. Eyes on the horizon line, Ghetto Gastro moves ever forward, and we cannot be prouder to have them leading the issue on the cover.',
